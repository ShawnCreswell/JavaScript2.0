    <h3>An Object is refernece datatype with key: value pairs.</h3>

    <p>An object in real life has characteristics and things it can do. For instance a car has a make, modle, number of wheels, color, etc..... These are the characteristics of the car. A car can also do drive, beep, etc. These are things a car can do. But in JS - we call these characteristics <em>Properties</em> </p>
    <p>And we call things an object can do <em>methods</em> A method is just a function that belongs to an object</p>
